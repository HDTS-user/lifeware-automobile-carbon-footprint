# Lifeware Automobile Carbon Footprint
Repository for Lifeware: Automobile Carbon Footprint offer on AWS Marketplace

How green is your car? Cars running on hyrocarbon based fuels are a major contributor of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere. With the sustainability becoming a decision criteria of acquiring a car along with the other usual attributes like performance, asthetics, reliability etc, this solution provides a simple way of ascertaining the running carbon footprint of the car. The solution uses supervised machine learning approch to predict the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in kg per km of running of a vehicle in standard conditions. The solution uses vehicle's dimensions, transmission, manufactured year, gears, horsepower, drive etc. to predict the fuel consumption and the carbon emission of the vehicle.

## Highlights
1. The machine learning solution can analyze various car attributes like engine size, fuel type, vehicle weight, and more to provide precise predictions of the car's carbon footprint and mileage. This helps car owners and potential buyers make informed decisions based on the environmental impact and fuel efficiency of the vehicle.
2. The machine learning solution can be integrated with various platforms and tools, making it easy for users to access and understand the predictions. This may include interactive dashboards, mobile applications, or integration with car dealership websites, allowing users to visualize and compare the carbon footprint and mileage of different vehicles easily.
